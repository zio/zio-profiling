The causal profiler lives in package `zio.profiling.causal`. It is experimental. It is inspired by [Coz](https://github.com/plasma-umass/coz): it selects a cost center, makes the rest of the program run relatively slower for a while, and counts how many progress points are reached. From that it estimates how much the program would speed up if the selected part were faster. For a how-to guide, see [Find a bottleneck with the causal profiler](../how-to/find-bottleneck-causal.md).

```scala mdoc:silent
import zio._

```

## CausalProfiler

```text
final case class CausalProfiler(
  iterations: Int = 100,
  candidateSelector: String => Boolean = _ => true,
  samplingPeriod: Duration = 20.millis,
  minExperimentDuration: Duration = 1.second,
  experimentTargetSamples: Int = 30,
  warmUpPeriod: Duration = 30.seconds,
  coolOffPeriod: Duration = 2.seconds,
  zeroSpeedupWeight: Int = 10,
  maxConsideredSpeedUp: Int = 100,
  sleepPrecision: Duration = 10.millis
)
```

| Parameter | Default | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| `iterations` | `100` | Number of experiments to run before the profile is complete. |
| `candidateSelector` | `_ => true` | Called with the last location of a candidate cost center. Only cost centers for which it returns `true` are selected for experiments. Cost centers that are the root are never selected. |
| `samplingPeriod` | `20.millis` | How often the profiler looks at where fibers are. Lower values increase overhead. |
| `minExperimentDuration` | `1.second` | Shortest length of an experiment. |
| `experimentTargetSamples` | `30` | Number of times each progress point should be reached during an experiment. The profiler lengthens or shortens the next experiment to get close to this number. |
| `warmUpPeriod` | `30.seconds` | Time to wait after the profile starts before the first experiment. |
| `coolOffPeriod` | `2.seconds` | Time to wait between two experiments. |
| `zeroSpeedupWeight` | `10` | On average, one experiment in every `zeroSpeedupWeight` applies no speedup at all, which gives a baseline to compare against. |
| `maxConsideredSpeedUp` | `100` | Largest speedup, as a percentage, that an experiment can apply. Values above 100 have no practical use. |
| `sleepPrecision` | `10.millis` | Estimated accuracy of `Thread.sleep`. Within this distance of the target time, the profiler busy-waits for accuracy. |

With the defaults, a profile takes at least `warmUpPeriod + iterations * (minExperimentDuration + coolOffPeriod)`, which is about 5.5 minutes. For tests and first runs, lower `warmUpPeriod`, `coolOffPeriod` and `iterations`.

```scala mdoc
CausalProfiler(iterations = 10, warmUpPeriod = 0.seconds).iterations
```

## Methods

| Method | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `profile` | `[R, E](zio: ZIO[R, E, Nothing]): ZIO[R, E, ProfilingResult]` | Runs `zio` until the profile is complete, then interrupts it and returns the result. `zio` must never end on its own: use `forever`. If `zio` finishes before enough data is collected, the profile dies with the message `Program completed before profiler could collect sufficient data`. |
| `profileIterations` | `[R, E](zio: ZIO[R, E, Any]): ZIO[R, E, ProfilingResult]` | Runs `zio` in a loop and adds a progress point named `iteration done` after each run. Use it when one run of `zio` is one unit of work. |
| `supervisor` | `ZIO[Scope, Nothing, Supervisor[ProfilingResult]]` | Creates the profiler as a supervisor, for use with `zio.supervised`. Reading its `value` waits until the profile is complete. The profiled effects must have OpSupervision enabled. |

## Progress and latency points

The companion object `CausalProfiler` has the functions that mark progress in your program. They do nothing when no profile is running.

| Function | Type | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| `progressPoint(name)` | `UIO[Unit]` | Counts one unit of progress under `name`. The profiler measures throughput as the rate of these counts. |
| `enterLatencyPoint(name)` | `UIO[Unit]` | Marks the start of a unit of work whose latency you want to track. |
| `exitLatencyPoint(name)` | `UIO[Unit]` | Marks the end of a unit of work started with `enterLatencyPoint`. |
| `latencyPointScoped(name)` | `URIO[Scope, Unit]` | Calls `enterLatencyPoint` now and `exitLatencyPoint` when the scope closes. |

```scala mdoc:compile-only
val request: UIO[Unit] =
  ZIO.scoped(CausalProfiler.latencyPointScoped("request") *> ZIO.succeed(Thread.sleep(10)))
```

Latency points count arrivals and departures during each experiment. `difference` in the output is arrivals minus departures: the number of units that entered during the experiment and had not left by its end.

## ProfilingResult

```text
final case class ProfilingResult(experiments: List[ExperimentResult])
```

| Member | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `experiments` | `List[ExperimentResult]` | One entry per completed experiment. |
| `render` | `String` | The experiments in the text format read by the Coz visualizer. |
| `renderToFile(path)` | `Task[Unit]` | Writes `render` to `path`, creating parent directories if needed. |

### ExperimentResult

```text
final case class ExperimentResult(
  selected: CostCenter,
  speedup: Float,
  duration: Long,
  effectiveDuration: Long,
  selectedSamples: Long,
  throughputData: List[ThroughputData],
  latencyData: List[LatencyData]
)
```

| Field | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `selected` | The cost center that was sped up in this experiment. |
| `speedup` | Fraction of speedup applied, from `0` to `1`. `0.25` means the selected part was made 25% faster, by slowing everything else. |
| `duration` | Planned length of the experiment, in nanoseconds. |
| `effectiveDuration` | `duration` minus the total delay that was added to the other code during the experiment, in nanoseconds. This is the time the selected code effectively had to itself. |
| `selectedSamples` | Number of delay steps counted during the experiment: one for each running fiber in the selected cost center at each sampling tick. Despite its name, this counts delay steps, not sampled time. |
| `throughputData` | How often each progress point was reached during the experiment. |
| `latencyData` | Arrivals and departures for each latency point. |

`render` writes one block per experiment. The first line starts with `experiment` and has the form:

```text
experiment	selected=<cost center>	speedup=<speedup>	duration=<effective duration>	selected-samples=<samples>
```

Each following line is a `throughput-point` line (`name`, `delta`) or a `latency-point` line (`name`, `arrivals`, `departures`, `difference`), one for each progress point and latency point. The fields are separated by tabs.

## Output

Load the file written by `renderToFile` into the [Coz visualizer](https://plasma-umass.org/coz/) to see the experiments as a chart. Each selected cost center is shown with the throughput change it caused at each speedup.
